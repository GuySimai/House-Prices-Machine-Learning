## About the competition
Ask a home buyer to describe their dream house, and they probably won't begin with the height of the basement ceiling or the proximity to an east-west railroad. But this playground competition's dataset proves that much more influences price negotiations than the number of bedrooms or a white-picket fence.
With 79 explanatory variables describing (almost) every aspect of residential homes in Ames, Iowa, this competition challenges you to predict the final price of each home.
In this project I process the data and create An efficient model that will predict the final price.

## Summary
The second part of the project was very interesting. I learned how to handle both numerical and categorical features, identifying the best methods for normalization and encoding. I used cross-validation to determine the most significant features for prediction and found the optimal hyperparameters for our model.

If I had more time, I would have explored additional models, not just the SGDRegressor.
